Welcome to my game called "Shopping List". As you can probably take away from the title, the game takes place in a local grocery store. 
The player will be given a shopping list of 4 items and will have to find the items in the isles and then exit the store to get back home.
I knew most people would make a dungeon/escape game, but I wanted to take a different, yet simple route with a shopping simulation game.
If the player exits and does not have all 4 items, or leaves with more than just those 4 items, the player will lose. 
There will be 10 isles in the game the player can go in, and the 4 items will be located in 
isles 1 (make it easy on them for the first one), 4, 8, and 9. Exit with just the 4 listed items and win! Goodluck!
